### Commits and pair programming 
Oscar (okorshavn) was responsible for importing the source code for the app to Github at the start of the project, and thus has a disproportionate amount of contribution to the master branch. 

We have also used pair programming during the project, and thus some of the members contribution haven't been recorded in Github since they've been working "through" other people.
